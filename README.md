# Predicton-of-Critical-Temperature-of-Superconductor-

In this project, it is going to use different prediction models to estimate the critical temperature for conductor's propoerties. In the dataset, there are eight properties and for each property it has ten features, those will be used to develop different prediction models. Prediction models will then be compared by mean squred error.

This project will also identify the key properties for a superconductor with reasonings.


## Result:

Prediction model that adopted random forest method has the smallest MSE, thus, the most accurate prediction.

The most important/key property for this superconductor dataset is atomic mass, as it has the highest vallue of importance (The value of importance is a measure of by how much removing a vairable decrease accuracy).
