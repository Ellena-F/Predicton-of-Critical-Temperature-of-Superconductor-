# Predicton-of-Critical-Temperature-of-Superconductor-

In this project, it is going to use 2 prediction models to estimate the critical temperature for conductor's propoerties. 

In the dataset, there are eight properties and for each property it has ten features, those will be used to develop different 
prediction models. This project will also identify the key properties for a superconductor with reasonings.
